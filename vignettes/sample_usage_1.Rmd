```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Load the package.

```{r}
library(experiment)
```

Build the first model.

```{r}
x <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Species, iris)
```


Try another model.

```{r}
```

Try one more model.

```{r}
```

Find all three models, extract them from the local stash, and compare
them in one plot.

```{r}
```

Finally, decide which model to put in the persistent storage.
This call will preserve the model object, the input data, and
automatically add tags to the model stored. On top of that, it
will extract the data object from the \code{lm} object and place
a hash instead to save the persistent storage space.

```{r}
```
