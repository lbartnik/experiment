* search:
  query_by(inherits("lm"))
  query_by(name("input"))

* Widget:
  - maximize tooltip/plot towards the center of the canvas
    add onmouseout to tooltip/plot in case it covers the node/miniature

  - make tooltip the size of the node and transparent, and then maximize
    it similarly to plots - the mouse cursor will stay "mouseover" throught
    the interaction

  - clicking on object/plot copies its ID to clipboard; the it can be
    restored in the session

  - export plots as PNG miniatures rather than SVG; for big/complex plots
    that might be much more efficient

* tracking
  wait for failed commands and if one arrives, check if the user entered
  a valid commit/object id, and if so, restore it

* explain: find a full sequence of calls leading to a given object
  - option to plot explanation as a graph with vis.js

* UI:
  - show history of commits
  - print commits
  - do not print commits in stashed()
  - show history of expressions in the current branch
  - list branches
  - name branches
  - clean the stash


* move plot.result to compare - plot.result should show something
  similar to plot.graph - a graph of inter-related objects
