Compiling a CoffeeScript into JavaScript

  <path-to-coffee>/coffee -w -t -c script.coffee

Example:

  ~/Projects/third-party/node/node_modules/.bin/coffee -w -t -c steps.coffee

If the JavaScript file is supposed to be used in RStudio, babel
transcompilations need to be applied as well. RStudio comes with
a little bit older JavaScript interpreter than e.g. Chrome does.
