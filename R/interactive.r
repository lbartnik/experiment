# Creating a new commit/checkout:
#
#  1. get the last commit
#  2. get the list of object names and see if any of them overlap with
#     the last commit
#  3. those that overlap we already have hashed in the last commit
#  4. those that have the same names but new contents need to be hashed
#  5. all new objects need to be hashed
#  6. put in the new commit:
#       - all names and their hashes
#       - the hash (id) of the last commit
#       - the contents of the history line (command) associated with creating
#         this new commit
#     (do we create a commit if none of the objects were changed? if the
#      history line is just printing something or opening help? rather not)
#  7. put the commit in the storage space
#  8. store all new objects and the commit object in the storage space

#' A callback run after each top-level expression is evaluated.

#' @param expr Expression for the top-level task.
#' @param result Result of the top-level task.
#' @param successful A logical value indicating whether it was
